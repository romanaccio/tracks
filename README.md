# tracks

This app is based on Udemy course <https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course>

It uses a node backend for authentication and saving data : see project track-server.

Instead of using javascript and react-navigation V4, I used typescript and react-navigation V6.
